# Easy RISE
RISE sucks and adding hours into it sucks even more.  This script will automatically fill out your time sheet for you for the work codes and hours you specify.

## Usage
Copy the contents of program.js and paste them into the developer console (F12) while on the time entry page.  Push Enter to execute the javascript and launch the tool.  Use the new dialog to enter your work codes (or at least part of a code, it'll look up a matching code on blur) and the number of hours you spent doing that task and then push Generate.

## Warnings
RISE is finicky.  This tool is finicky.  I wrote it in notepad and it's not amazing, but it works consistently in both FireFox and Chrome.  **It will fail** if you have existing time entries on the page.  **It will fail** if you have added or removed entries on the page since it loaded.  For best results, remove any existing entires, refresh the page, and then run the tool.

## Warranty
None.  Good luck, have fun.
